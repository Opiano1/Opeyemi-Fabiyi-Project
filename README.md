+ Business Case

Climate change is projected to increase the frequency and intensity of some extreme weather events which is likely to damage transportation infrastructure and cause a disruption in the public transport and increase the risk of delays and failure due to storm, flooding and higher temperatures affecting the reliability and capacity of the public transportation.

- The Goal

Can you analyze the weather data to predict public transport service disruption in Dubai? How can we plan for less disruption in the wake of severe weather conditions and leverage the emergency management plan as well as providing uninterrupted services and products to citizens?
